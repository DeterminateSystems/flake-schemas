# Flake Schemas

This flake provides a set of schema definitions for commonly used flake output types. It's used by default for flakes that do not have a `schemas` output.

It supports the following flake output types:

* `checks`
* `devShells`
* `hydraJobs`
* `legacyPackages`
* `nixosConfigurations`
* `overlays`
* `packages`
* `schemas`
